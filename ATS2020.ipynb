Reducing exposure to environmental triggers, which can be exacerbated after a natural disaster, are an important component of asthma control. Evidence-based interventions, such as guidelines-based medical management, smoking cessation, asthma self-management education, home visits, and asthma-friendly policies, support asthma control. \\nA new CDC initiative, CCARE (Controlling Childhood Asthma Reducing Emergencies), aims to prevent a half-million pediatric asthma-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations in 5 years. To achieve this goal, CCARE will promote evidence-based interventions across sectors and linkages between programs and clinics.\\n',\n",

Emerging data in genetics, immunology, inflammation, and the microbiome that are beginning to elucidate the pathophysiology of bronchiectasis and pNTM susceptibility will be highlighted. Real-world difficult cases will be presented and discussed with expert panelists.

They will demonstrate appropriate use of targeted therapies, and describe best practices for monitoring for adverse effects of therapies.Topics will also cover clinically relevant biologic mechanisms of asthma, and address whether phenotyping and endotyping can improve outcomes.

Innovative thinking and cutting-edge research in medicine shows promise to translate key discoveries into novel drugs. However, many researchers and clinicians are not familiar with the best practices when developing novel drugs in academia. Here, attendees will discover real-life examples about building a NewCo at a University with particular focus on lung diseases relevant to the ATS. This course will focus on how to decide if an idea is ready for commercialization, approaches to strengthen Intellectual Property (patents) and what is required to enable application for an IND. The session will also discuss business grant proposals and work with Venture Capitalists (VCs) to raise funds. For more details on the course please visit our RCMB webpage and video.\\n',\n",

Innovative thinking and cutting-edge research in medicine shows promise to translate key discoveries into novel drugs. However, many researchers and clinicians are not familiar with the best practices when developing novel drugs in academia. Here, attendees will discover real-life examples about building a NewCo at a University with particular focus on lung diseases relevant to the ATS. This course will focus on how to decide if an idea is ready for commercialization, approaches to strengthen Intellectual Property (patents) and what is required to enable application for an IND. The session will also discuss business grant proposals and work with Venture Capitalists (VCs) to raise funds. For more details on the course please visit our RCMB webpage and video.\\n',\n",

       "  'Description': '\\nDescription\\nPAH continues to remain a fatal disease with a median survival of 5-7 years. Currently there are 13 FDA approved PAH-specific therapies for the management of PAH. They increase exercise capacity modestly and reduce hospital admission, but are expensive and not curative. Since 2005, no new therapeutic pathways have been identified for the treatment of PAH. There is a clear unmet need for novel treatments for PAH that improve long-term outcomes. \\n\\nAdvances in computational and systems biology coupled with the rapidly growing data from electronic health records as well as human molecular profiling provides opportunities to leverage big data and repurpose existing drugs for novel clinical purposes to promote cardiopulmonary health. This session intends to explore the current state of the art methods and ongoing challenges to utilize network biology, machine learning, and artificial intelligence for defining novel uses for existing drugs, the experimental platforms needed for those predictions, and the clinical ramifications for incorporating these processes in translational practice. \\n\\nIn addition, this session will highlight novel therapies that are in phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of PAH.\\n',\n",
       "  'Objectives': '\\n\\n\\nObjective 1\\nDefine new strategies to identify already existing drugs that could be used in the treatment of cardiopulmonary disease.\\nObjective 2\\nLearn new ways to apply machine learning and artificial intelligence in the practice of managing cardiopulmonary disease. \\nObjective 3\\nFamiliarize novel therapeutic agents for PAH that are in early phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials \\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'Description': '\\nDescription\\nPediatric pulmonary hypertension (PH) contributes to high morbidity and mortality in children with diverse lung, heart and systemic diseases, yet major gaps in our understanding of its natural history, pathobiology, diagnostic approaches and therapy persist. Despite sharing similarities with adult disease, many aspects of pediatric PH are distinct from adult PH, as childhood PH is intrinsically linked to issues of lung growth and development,and  associated with unique diseases of childhood and has apparent differences in responsiveness to therapies. Thus, pediatric PH has been largely understudied and much remains poorly understood regarding its epidemiology, long-term outcomes and approaches for care.\\n',\n",
